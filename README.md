-side scroller (finite screen, left is the planet express ship, all the way right is a barrier [probably the rodeo + amy])

deliver to MARS --> there is a rodeo happening on Mars and amy needs to win it to fill her cabinet of awards, but she left her
stuff at work and that is why fry and bender are delivering it on short notice

package
   -amy's lucky rodeo saddle (bender mini game, have to press x as fast as you can)
   -amy's pink designer boots (you get from Zapp Brannigan)
   -her hat (line dancing with fry against someone OR some kind of puzzle idk)

after delivering everything, bender and fry board the ship. On the way back home, bender is drinking from the 1st place cup that he stole from the rodeo

timeline
-start off in planet express
	+dr. farnsworth tells you the good news; you and bender have to make a delivery to mars
	+you need to prepare to go on the trip
-by the time you come back from getting dark matter for the ship, your package has been destroyed-- bender explains that a few of your coworkers
	wanted some of the items in the package
	
	OR

-could probably do something like a minigame with an asteroid belt (or if worse comes to worse, make that the focus of the game)
	
-you get in the ship and get to the moon, but when getting there, bender pulls a stunt and causes the package to get destroyed. The three items you need are
scattered around the moon (or whatever planet I decide eventually)
	+you have to get the items back by solving puzzels/running errands for people to get them to give you what you want
	+1 item can be gotten from simply solving one of the puzzles, probably through a hint you get from someone (probably maybe bender)
	+another item you can get from a character
	+last item can be gotten from doing a performance of some sort

-once you get all the items, you can ask bender to make it into a package again and deliver it into the right hands (probably will make it amy rather than any of her parents)
-end screen
